/*
Topological sort:
Build graph: 
a map of character -> set of character.
Also get in-degrees for each character. In-degrees will be a map of character -> integer.
Topological sort:
Loop through in-degrees. Offer the characters with in-degree of 0 to queue.
While queue is not empty:
Poll from queue. Append to character to result string.
Decrease the in-degree of polled character's children by 1.
If any child's in-degree decreases to 0, offer it to queue.
At last, if result string's length is less than the number of vertices, that means there is a cycle in my graph. The order is invalid.

O(N+C) where N is the number of words present in the Alien dictionary and C is 26 for all the lower case characters.
O(N+C) where N is the number of words present in the Alien dictionary and C is 26 for all the lower case characters. We create a graph or adjacency list in which the size of the adjacency list is 26(C).
