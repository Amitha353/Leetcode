Amazon's Fulfillment Center consists of a packaging bay where orders are automatically packaged in 
groups(n). The first group can only have 1 item and all the subsequent groups can have one item more
than the previous group.
Given a list of items on groups, perform certain operations in order to satisfy the constraints
required by packaging automation.

The conditions are as follows:
- The first group must contain 1 item only.
- For all other groups, the difference between the number of items in adjacent groups must not be
greater than 1.
- In other words, for 1<=i<n, arr[i]-arr[i-1]<=1
- To accomplish this, the following operations are available.
- Rearrange the groups in any way.
- Reduce any group to any number that is at least 1

Write an algorithm to find the maximum number of items that can be packaged in the last group with 
the conditions in place.

Input
The function/method consists of two arguments:
- numGroups, an integer representing the number of groups(n);
- arr, a list of integers representing the number of items in each group

Output
- Return an integer representing the maximum items that can be packaged for the final group of the 
list given the conditions above.

Examples:
Input: numGroups = 4, arr = [1,3,2,2]
Output: 3
Input: numGroups = 4, arr = [3,2,3,5]
Output: 4
